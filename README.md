# character_recognition
A Deep Learning based character recognition model for characters, digits and special characters

## Concept
Created a character recognition deep learning based pipeline which includes scripts for :
- generating synthetic char dataset using any no. of fonts
- generating bulk char dataset folders
- multiple model backbones
- training pipeline to train on the char dataset
- allows addition of special chars

## Results
### Synthetic Chars
